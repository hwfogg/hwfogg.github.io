		<p>"Recently, Kelly and Hannah of Ducks in a Row helped me create Financial and Life Inventories.  Though I am independent and well-organized, I found the process of getting all my information in one place very rewarding.  There were a few things I was missing in my files, but now everything is in place.  Instead of my important papers spread in a few different spots, I now have two well organized, cataloged binders.  Their system for organizing documents is very helpful.  Kelly and Hannah are efficient, respectful, honest and lovely to spend time with. I feel good knowing my daughter can step in to help me at any time and everything she needs will be up-to-date and easy to find."

		"In the 10 years that I have known Hannah, I have valued her loyalty, support and honesty. I admired the meticulousness she demonstrated in her management of her elderly father&rsquo;s affairs enabling him to stay living at home.  On any given topic, Hannah has the ability to assess a situation, evaluate her options, and develop a plan of action based on careful research and analysis.  She is one of the most thorough, organized and detail-oriented people I know, and it shines through in every facet of her work.  Hannah&rsquo;s knowledge of business and financial management coupled with her patient and warm personality is perfectly suited for daily money management."

	<p>"Kelly and I have worked together on many projects over the past nine years.   She has taken on a variety of different roles as a board member of Social Service Association of Ridgewood and Vicinity and is currently serving a two-year term as President.  As an organization, we strive to help local families in need of food, emergency utility assistance, and childcare.  Kelly&rsquo;s enthusiasm, commitment and persistence in making necessary changes has helped us to grow in a thoughtful, positive manner.  She is compassionate and organized and a pleasure to work with."

	<p>"I was a caregiver for Hannah&rsquo;s father. Through this relationship, I developed tremendous respect for her, and she has become a forever friend. Mr. Weeks suffered from Alzheimers and with Hannah&rsquo;s help he was able to remain in his home and live a full life.  Hannah coordinated his schedule among his 24/7 caregivers and suggested activities and interests that Mr. Weeks enjoyed.  It was Hannah&rsquo;s top priority to ensure that her father&rsquo;s life was running smoothly and that he be as engaged in life as possible.   She also managed his financial and medical concerns. Mr. Weeks lived in New Hampshire and Hannah in New Jersey, and I was grateful knowing she was always available to consult by phone day or night. Hannah is caring, organized and trustworthy.  I appreciate the time I was able to share with my treasured friend Mr. Weeks and the memories that he left me."
