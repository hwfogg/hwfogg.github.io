<section id="ourstory">
	<p>Over the past few years, each of our fathers battled a terminal illness.   We took over the administrative responsibilities related to our fathers' households and care.  Being organized helped life run smoothly during a very difficult time for our families.  We kept asking ourselves, <q>who would they turn to if they didn&#8217;t have us?</q>  We have a deep respect and appreciation for maintaining one&#8217;s independence for as long as possible. We have come to realize that sometimes one just needs a little help.</p>
 
	<p>The experiences with our fathers opened our eyes to the need for assistance with bills and paperwork, not solely for seniors with memory impairment or illness, but for those with physical limitations or simply the desire to focus on other things.</p>
 
	<p>Our situations also highlighted the importance of having crucial documents and information organized and easily accessible if a loved one needs to get involved.  Our cataloging system is a useful reference tool for everyday life.  It is also an invaluable resource to be used when unforeseen circumstances arise, such as changes in physical or mental health, a hospital stay or settling an estate.  This system benefits the client, spouses and the next generation.  Taking these steps early, when healthy and in a good state of mind, makes these situations less stressful.</p>


	<p> We understand and appreciate the sensitivity of the information you entrust us with and operate in a completely confidential and ethical manner and uphold the highest standard of integrity. We are patient, compassionate and organized!  We enjoy making a positive impact on seniors&#8217; quality of life.</p>
