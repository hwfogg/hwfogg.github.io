		<h5> Hannah Fogg, Co-Founder</h5>
		<p>My interest in helping seniors stems from experience with my father as he suffered with dementia. For 5 years I was his <q>personal bookkeeper</q> managing his routine financial tasks. I kept track of his expenses, helped him pay his bills and stay organized enabling him to stay in his home. It was a trying time for me and my family, and it is very rewarding for me to help other seniors navigate these matters and keep their lives running smoothly.   My professional background is in finance, working in pharmaceuticals and banking. I have an MBA in finance and marketing from Duke University and a BA in mathematical economics from Colgate University.  I serve on the Woodlea/Path 1 Advisory Board and deliver meals as a volunteer for Community Meals. Chatting with the seniors on my route always brightens my day.

		<h5>Kelly Petersen, Co-Founder</h5>
		<p>Being part of a close-knit family as my dad battled cancer was so important to me.  We served as a great support system for one another &mdash; each doing what he could to make life run as smoothly as possible during some difficult times.  It seemed very natural for me to take on most of the administrative responsibilities of my parents&rsquo; household.  My professional background is in finance and sales. I have a BS in finance from Fairfield University.  I have been an active community volunteer for the past twenty years and enjoy managing projects and keeping things on track.  I have served as president of The Ridgewood Newcomers Club, The Orchard Home and School Association, and Social Service Association of Ridgewood and Vicinity.  I have also been an active volunteer at my sons&rsquo; respective schools and at Ridgewood Country Club.  I enjoy helping helping seniors reduce stress and enjoy life.</p>
